Hello! This is BotBot, a programming project turned functional Discord bot made entirely by Jacob Smith.
Development started with a rough prototype in November of 2022, where he could only respond to BBhello with 'Hello!'.
Since then, it has become a character in my friend communities, known for hilarious timings, funny responses,
and wide range of functionality. The highlighs of his abilities are:
    Can play games such as hangman, number guessing, and word of the day
    Virtual currency of "BotCoin", which can be earned, spent, and transferred
    Activity tracking, such as a users most used words, most listened to songs, etc.
    Botify wrapped, showing an approximation of a certain users data in a Discord-friendly embed
    Tens of commands of miscellaneous functionality, such as the magic 8 ball, adding animal pics, and making suggestions

There is over a years worth of experience and progress in this project, and it has become a passion of mine.
My friends ask to add him to every new server we make, and they have been loving it as much as I have.

Things i would do differently if i started over:
    Turn all commands into their own functions using the updated discord api
    Possibly use Java/JS
    organize ahead of time instead of re-organizing every few months
    Isolate large text blocks into separate files in \\data

In lieu of re-documenting for a third time, Below are some screenshots showing some fun moments. Enjoy!
